# Dynasty App 2.0

A secure family history and document management application.

## Project Status

### Core Features

#### Vault (üü¢ Active Development)
The vault provides secure storage for sensitive family documents and media.

**Current Status:**
- ‚úÖ Core vault functionality implemented
- ‚úÖ Face ID/Touch ID authentication
- ‚úÖ Secure document encryption/decryption
- ‚úÖ Document management (upload, download, delete)
- ‚úÖ Proper authentication flow and state management
- ‚úÖ Memory optimization and database management
- ‚úÖ Auto-locking on app background/tab switch
- ‚úÖ Unified file view (documents, photos, videos)
- ‚úÖ Search and filter functionality
- ‚úÖ Progress tracking for file operations
- ‚úÖ Video thumbnail generation and playback
- ‚úÖ Recycling bin functionality
- ‚úÖ Firebase Storage integration with proper error handling

**Authentication Flow:**
1. Default State:
   - Vault starts locked
   - Requires Face ID/device password for access
2. Access Flow:
   - User taps vault tab
   - Face ID/Touch ID prompt appears
   - On success: Shows vault contents
   - On cancel/fail: Returns to previous tab
3. Security Features:
   - Auto-locks when:
     - Switching tabs
     - App enters background
     - Session timeout
   - Requires re-authentication for each access
   - Secure key management
   - Data encryption at rest

**File Management:**
1. Upload:
   - Multiple file type support (documents, photos, videos)
   - Progress tracking
   - Automatic thumbnail generation
   - Type-specific handling
2. Storage:
   - Firebase Storage integration
   - User-specific storage paths
   - Secure file encryption
3. Interface:
   - Unified grid view for all files
   - Search functionality
   - Type filtering
   - Progress indicators
   - Thumbnail previews

**Recent Improvements:**
- Implemented unified file view
- Added search and filtering
- Added video support with thumbnails
- Improved file operation progress tracking
- Enhanced error handling
- Added recycling bin functionality
- Improved Firebase Storage integration

**Known Issues:**
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Large file handling needs optimization
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Video playback needs improvement
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Thumbnail caching could be optimized

**Next Steps:**
1. Performance Optimizations:
   - Implement thumbnail caching
   - Optimize large file handling
   - Add background upload support
2. Enhanced Features:
   - Add file sharing functionality
   - Implement file categorization/tags
   - Add batch operations
3. User Experience:
   - Add drag-and-drop support
   - Improve error messages
   - Add file preview functionality
4. Security:
   - Add file integrity checks
   - Implement version control
   - Add audit logging
